# Pokemon Name Search App

This app was written in React Native. I tried to avoid as many third-party libraries as possible. The aim of this app is to allow a user to search for Pokemon names or their IDs.

Libraries used:

- Axios: to do API requests
- Native-base: to provide native UI components
- React & React Native
- React-Spinners: For loading spinners, but I came up with my own solution

This app is still a work-in-progress.
